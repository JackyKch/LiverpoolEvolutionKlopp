## Introduction
This is a project led by three engineers students in Paris: Ibrahim NASSAR, Thomas TRANG and myself, Jacky KUOCH. The objective of this project was to discover the use of Data in the football world, as we are all huge fans of football, and to put into practice the notions that we learnt during our various courses.
At the end of our semester, I decided to pursue this project on my own by writing an article with football data visualizations.

## Context 
In history, Liverpool F.C. has won nineteen English Premier League titles. However, before the 2019/2020 season, Liverpool had't been crowned champion for more than 20 years. 
After numerous successful seasons at the top of European football, Liverpool wasn't able to compete with the top teams in England anymore. Liverpool's board decided that it was
time for change and, in 2015, Brendan Rodgers was replaced by Jürgen Klopp. The German has transformed the team into a winning machine taking his team to finals in the League Cup,
Europa League and Champions League in such quick succession and finally, in 2020, everything fell into place when Liverpool brought back home the league title after a historic season.

## Question

How can we explain, through Data, Jürgen Klopp's influence over Liverpool's comeback to the top of European football ?

## Tasks and Skills

- Webscrapping using Selenium library to retrieve interesting football data.
- Data Exploration using Matplotlib and Seaborn to observe data retrieved.
- Machine Learning using SciKitLearn to apply supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on specific data.
- Result Analysis in a report to list and present our results. 

## What you can find in this repository

- Python scripts in Jupyter notebooks. 
- Data stored in csv files.
- Project report written in French. 
- Data Visualizations created for Jacky's article.
